Modified Simpsons TV Script
Credit goes to Brandon Withrow for the original project https://withrow.io/simpsons-tv-build-guide
Also highping for the modified HDMI version https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5019648
And johnyHV for the code I modified for my needs  https://github.com/johnyHV/simpsonstv/
Hopefully this helps someone, I wanted the VCR buttons to function but changed the code so that double press would restart the current playing video
